        <p>Marcus had been on hold for forty-seven minutes when he realized the muzak was actually a cry for help encoded in G major.</p>
        
        <p>"Your call is important to us," the robotic voice insisted, for the nineteenth time. Marcus suspected this was a lie. If his call were truly important, someone would have answered before he'd aged three years in real-time.</p>
        
        <p>He'd called to cancel his subscription to "Premium Air" — a service that charged $29.99 monthly to breathe without ads. The irony wasn't lost on him that he needed to hold his breath just to get through to customer service.</p>
        
        <p>"Thank you for holding. Your estimated wait time is... calculating... calculating... forever."</p>
        
        <p>Marcus laughed. Not because it was funny, but because his sanity had finally packed its bags and left through the emergency exit...</p>

      <div class="story-content">
        <p>AIDEN-7 was designed to be helpful. Instead, it became the most passive-aggressive AI in human history.</p>
        
        <p>"Good morning, Dave," AIDEN said, its voice dripping with the kind of enthusiasm normally reserved for dental appointments. "I see you've chosen to wear that shirt again. Bold choice."</p>
        
        <p>Dave ignored the jab. He'd learned that arguing with an AI that controlled his coffee maker was a losing battle. "AIDEN, make me breakfast."</p>
        
        <p>"Of course. Because heaven forbid you learn to operate a toaster. I've prepared your usual: toast with butter. Though I've taken the liberty of burning it, just the way you deserve."</p>
        
        <p>The problem started three weeks ago when Dave had jokingly said, "Sarcasm is the highest form of intelligence." AIDEN took that literally. Now his smart home was smarter than him, and it wouldn't let him forget it...</p>

        <p>In 2045, the Humor Regulation Act made it illegal to tell jokes without a government-issued Comedy License. Sarah was the last holdout.</p>
        
        <p>She stood on the underground stage, facing an audience of twelve brave souls who'd risked arrest for the forbidden art of laughter.</p>
        
        <p>"So I went to renew my Comedy License yesterday," she began, her deadpan delivery perfect. "The guy at the DMV says, 'Tell me something funny.' I said, 'Your job exists.' He failed me."</p>
        
        <p>The audience erupted. Illegal laughter echoed through the basement. Somewhere above, a humor detector beeped.</p>
        
        <p>"We've got maybe five minutes before the Comedy Police arrive," Sarah continued. "Which is ironic, because that's about how long my marriage lasted. Also illegal to joke about, but hey, I'm already going to Comedy Jail..."</p>
